# NomlTest

A haxe version of the famous shmup NomlTest implemented using keim's great CannonML and SiON libraries.
This provides an example of one way these libraries can be used. There are many other ways these libraries
can be used, so don't feel like you have to stick with exactly this example.

Haxe ports of all of these were done by Brian Gunn (github@gunnbr.org).

This also gives a demonstration of how to use Haxe on the Ouya. As this is an Ouya example, some of the assets,
such as the instruction screen graphics, are specific to Ouya.

To compile for Ouya, use: "lime test android -Douya"
